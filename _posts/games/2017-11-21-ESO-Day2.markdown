“This is Fish Herrington. Back in high school he was king of his class in the finishing village of Troutown that’s located in Tamriel's less know region of… somewhere near the back. Also he is a wizard. He awoke one day in a cell in Coldharbour and learned he was dead. It is there that he faced the horrors of tutorial quests and only when he completed them all could he be free again, free to roam on an island of cats. “  

The second day of playing was fun yet short as it is after all a workday. Working family people, how do you find the time for long form role playing games?  

As I start to gain levels, more and more abilities become available to unlock with the points you get upon level up. Now at level 7, I find every level up event to be stressful as I start to have a mini panic attack over which ability to unlock or morph. The more I play, the more become available. I’m scared to pick up any new kind of weapon, dreading the addition of a new skill line. 
I do however feel very strong at this level. Even though the enemies scale with your level, all the new magic I’ve learned and the destruction staff I’m wielding make me feel like I’m growing into a proper wizard. 
I’ve arrived at a city called Mistral which is the biggest I’ve seen yet. The sight of it is impressive but there weren’t as many people there as I had hoped to see. Maybe it was the hour.
