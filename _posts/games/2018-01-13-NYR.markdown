I just found out that there's a second game based on The Fifth Element in existence. It's called NYR (New York Race) and it's a racing game. Then I found out there's a Gameboy Color version of said game. That sounded amazing.
So I thought I would write a cool article showing all the different cool cars you can get and show all the cool pixel art. Like, check out all this stuff:
The taxi can actually fly up and down. Really cool.

And can we acknowledge this sick rotation animation?

But then, umm, the other cars cost money.

I tried to play through one race but it just feels so tedious. I'm not a very good game journalist...
