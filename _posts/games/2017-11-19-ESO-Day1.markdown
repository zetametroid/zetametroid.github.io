I read some good things about this one so I thought I’d give it a try. I wasn’t sure what kind of game to expect since my experience with MMOs was limited to games of the “click on a dude once and if you’re rally advanced, click on him twice” genre and I figured they were all like that. ESO surprised me by playing exactly like any other recent Bethesda game. From the graphics to the gameplay, if I didn’t know better I’d think this was Skyrim. But I’m liking that. It means I got a new Elder Scroll game to play that just happens to be online.  

I play alone mostly and on the first day of playing this game I didn’t feel like I was missing out on anything by going it solo. It does seem like this part of the game is meant to be played on your own so it remains to be seen how things will go from here. Though seeing people running around is undeniably fun and makes the world feel alive. On one memorable occasion, I ended up with my back against a wall fighting two beach sheegoths. My health was draining fast when an armored man showed up out of the horizon, slew my attackers with a flying fire flip, and then ran back from whence he came before I could reach. Whoever you are, acrobatic fireman, you have my thanks.  

Overall I’m going to sleep tonight with Tamriel still on my mind. I can’t wait to continue my adventure. I’m glad to know that as an online game it will continue to grow and the adventure will not end very soon.
