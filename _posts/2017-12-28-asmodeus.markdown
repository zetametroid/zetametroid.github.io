I was playing Shin Megami Tensei 4 on 3DS and was surprised to meet this little fella:
<div class="ui medium centered image">
<div class="ui bottom attached black label">Spiky man</div>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/pictures/screenshots/asmodeus.jpg">
</div>
Asmodeus, Greek name of Ashmedai, and I was surprised too because he's depicted quite similarly to how I drew him. Except mine is much cuter.
